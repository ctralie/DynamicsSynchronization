# Notebook Examples

* RotatedPatches: A notebook which goes through the main steps in the paper, including masked Mahalanobis diffusion maps on rotated observations, flattening the torus state space, and uncovering the rotation angles

* LineSegmentsToPatches: A notebook which shows how, given only 4 correspondences between a set of observations which are traveling observers (line segments) and (unrotated) patches, how it is possible to derive the full set of correspondences.

* LineSegments_HorizontalToVertical: A notebook which shows how to match 4 time series to 4 space series in order to match the full set
